Interview Script 1

Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for participating in this interview. Let's jump right in. How do you typically unwind after studying? Do you prefer playing games or doing something else?

Interviewee: I like to relax by playing games, hitting the gym, or going for a ride.

Interviewer: That sounds like a good mix of activities. And how many hours a day do you usually spend playing games?

Interviewee: I'd say about 3 to 4 hours, mostly in the morning.

Interviewer: Got it. What are your thoughts on someone who plays games for several hours every day and seems quite immersed in them?

Interviewee: I think as long as it doesn't interfere with their studies, it's not a big concern.

Interviewer: That's a fair perspective. Do you believe you currently have a gaming addiction?

Interviewee: No, I don't.

Interviewer: That's good to hear. In what situations do you find your self-discipline is strongest? And do you think listening to white noise can help you overcome a gaming addiction? If so, what type of white noise?

Interviewee: I find I have better self-discipline when I stick to a regular routine, engage in physical activity, and have social interactions. As for white noise, it's helpful for studying efficiency, but it doesn't do much for a gaming addiction.\

Interviewer: Thanks for sharing that. Would you prefer if the software had social features, like chatting with friends while listening to music or having virtual rooms?

Interviewee: It's not a priority for me. I'm not particularly interested in that.

Interviewer: I understand. When it comes to using a similar app, how has your usage frequency changed from when you started to when you stopped using it?

Interviewee: I started off using it quite frequently, but over time, the novelty wore off, and I found it less engaging.

Interviewer: That's a common experience. What features do you believe a gaming addiction solution software should have, and which ones would you value the most?

Interviewee: I think it should have features for time management and tracking usage. Also, adding achievement rewards could be helpful. In terms of social features, it could categorize and analyze which games are played most frequently and which ones users want to cut down on, based on their playtime.







































Interview Script 2

Interviewer: Hello! It's great to have you here. Let's get started. After studying, how do you usually unwind? Do you prefer playing games or doing something else?

Interviewee: I relax by playing games, watching videos, getting some rest, or doing some exercise.

Interviewer: That sounds like a good mix of activities. On average, how many hours a day do you spend playing games?

Interviewee: It varies, but I'd say around 2 to 3 hours on average.

Interviewer: Got it. What are your thoughts on someone who plays games for several hours every day and seems quite immersed in them?

Interviewee: I don't think playing for 5 hours a day necessarily means someone is addicted. It just seems like a lot of time to spend on it, and it might feel like a bit of a waste.

Interviewer: That's a fair perspective. Do you consider yourself to have a gaming addiction at the moment?

Interviewee: No, I don't.

Interviewer: That's good to hear. In what situations do you find your self-discipline is strongest? And do you believe listening to white noise can help you overcome a gaming addiction? If so, what type of white noise?

Interviewee: I find I have better self-discipline when I have a regular routine, engage in physical activity, and have social interactions. As for white noise, it's helpful for studying efficiency, but it doesn't really help with a gaming addiction.

Interviewer: Thanks for sharing that. Would you prefer if the software had social features, like chatting with friends while listening to music or having virtual rooms?

Interviewee: It's not a main priority for me, but I'm open to it. Having the option to chat with friends can be nice.

Interviewer: I understand. When it comes to using a similar app, how has your usage frequency changed from when you started to when you stopped using it?

Interviewee: Initially, I used it quite frequently, but over time, the novelty wore off, and I found it less engaging.

Interviewer: That's a shared experience. What features do you believe a gaming addiction solution software should have, and which ones would you value the most?

Interviewee: I think it should provide guidance and enforce limits. For instance, users should be restricted from playing for too long each day. It could also offer suggestions, like prompting them to exercise, study, or socialize.

Interviewer: That sounds practical. Lastly, what are your thoughts on implementing a sharing system where you can showcase your achievements and potentially boost your motivation?

Interviewee: I think it's a valuable feature. Sharing achievements can boost confidence and provide a sense of satisfaction, both for oneself and others who see it.
