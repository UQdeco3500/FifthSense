After conducting interviews, we discovered that gamers don't believe music can effectively help them overcome game addiction. 
However, sharing achievements does hold some appeal and can motivate them to use the app, thus increasing their drive to reduce game time. 
Our survey also revealed that those struggling with game addiction tend to allocate excessive hours to gaming, often at the expense of their studies, leading to a decline in academic performance. 
As a response, we've shifted the focus of the app to prioritize time management for game addicts. 
This way, they can allocate more time to their daily responsibilities, subsequently reducing their gaming hours and regaining control over their habits without compromising their studies.

Consequently, we've refined the app's features. 
We have replaced the initial concept of music therapy with a dynamic and achievement-sharing function, creating a micro-community that fosters greater user interaction. 
Users have the ability to establish personal objectives and assign specific timeframes to each task. 
Upon successful completion within the designated time, the task is marked as accomplished. As users reach specific milestones by finishing a set number of tasks, they will unlock extra bonus, such as discount coupons or vouchers. 
Additionally, users can earn achievements for their accomplishments. 
Additionally, we've introduced multi-purpose rooms where users can engage in various activities simultaneously, such as online study sessions and virtual gym sessions. 
Users can simply click on the activity of interest and join the corresponding room. 
This setup promotes mutual support and encouragement among users.
